Client and server communicate through request response cycle.
Here client requests the server according its requirement and server responses to the request.
To request a server one should know the IP address . This IP address is too comlicated to remember, so we are given a sting for name called domain name which icludes the name and extension.
The work ofconverting domain name to IP addressis done by Name servers.
